@ashleyxholcomb I‚Äôve never been as an adult. Maybe I‚Äôll go the next time the nats play the Red Sox in Boston.

Yall be following players but not TEAMS? someone leave my team thas it wish them the best but its still Dolphins,Jazz an Red Sox till its over!
@LindortoSTLSzn Also if you want more competition you wouldn‚Äôt want the rays to get better, you would want the blue Jays and Red Sox and orioles to get better.

@barefootnonna @JoeNBC Other than the fact that he is a FL lad and pulls for the Red Sox and not the Rays. Even moreso now, that the Ray‚Äôs have ‚Äòcleansed‚Äô the baseball gods by exorcising the Evil Empire and sending the Adulterous Astros to the confessional last season.
@BostonStrong_34 You guys know what's crazy? When I found out the Red Sox traded for Chris Sale I was out on a run with the track team and tripped and need 5 stitches in my left thumb it was worth it and they got Mitchy 2 bags.

RT @PeteSouris: This is a class move by the Red Sox
@imbecilesrus i do not care at all about the patriots, red sox, or bruins.
Tzu-Wei Lin‚Äôs first stint with the Red Sox in 2017 was legendary. Best of luck with the Twins, Tzu-Wei.

@royalsreview @LaMar_Matt @Royals I would like to see Mitch Moreland in a Royals uniform in 2021. He hit .328/8HR/21RBI in 22 games with Red Sox in 2020. He is American League guy and has always hit at Kauffman. He is the middle of lineup bat we need. Put Dozier back at 3B. Let‚Äôs go!!!
@fake_biden Are you a Red Sox fan?
@TrevRosenthal Sounded like you fell in love with SD. Hope they want to keep you around. If not, my Red Sox need some bullpen help! üò¨üò¨

@TheLillis @ballparkdigest I like the play with Flair, but the Pawtucket Red Sox got the PawSox nickname organically, this tool bag decided he didn't want to wait around for it and just named it WooSox, because he thinks fans really like stupid dumbed down things
Being a Chargers fan is like being a Red Sox fan before 2004.. I happen to be both for life!
